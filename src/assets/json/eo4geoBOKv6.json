The manipulations of spatial and spatio-temporal data involve two general classes of operation: 1.\tTheir transformation into formats that facilitate subsequent analysis (see this Unit AM13), 2.\tGeneralization and aggregation that affect the accuracy and integrity of the data used for analysis (see Unit AM14) Other knowledge areas have identified different forms of data structures, data models, projections, and other forms of geospatial data representation. These differences present both opportunities and challenges for analysis and modeling. The ability to transform one representation to another, in a manner that maintains the integrity of the information as much as possible, can enhance the analysis and visualization of geospatial data.

Data analysis seeks to understand both first-order (environmental) effects and second-order (interaction) effects. Approaches that are both data-driven (exploration of geospatial data) and model-driven (testing hypotheses and creating models) are included. Data driven techniques derive summary descriptions of data, evoke insights about characteristics of data, contribute to the development of research hypotheses, and lead to the derivation of analytical results. The goal of model driven analysis is to create and test geospatial process models. In general, model-driven analysis is an advanced knowledge area where previous experience with exploratory spatial data analysis would constitute a desired prerequisite. Visual tools for data analysis are covered in Knowledge Area: Cartography and Visualization (CV) and many of the fundamental principles required to ground data analysis techniques are introduced in Knowledge Area: Conceptual Foundations (CF). Image processing techniques are considered in Knowledge Area: Geospatial Data (GD). All of the methods described in this knowledge area are more or less sensitive to data error and uncertainty as covered in Unit GC8 Uncertainty and Unit GD6 Data quality.

            "definition": "The GIScience perspective is grounded in spatial thinking. The aim of this knowledge area is to recognize, identify, and appreciate the explicit spatial, spatio-temporal and semantic components of the geographic environment at an ontological and epistemological level in preparation for modeling the environment with geographic data and analysis. To do this, one must understand the nature of space and time as a context for geographic phenomena.This knowledge area covers the ways in which views of the geographic environment depend on philosophical viewpoints, physics, human cognition, society, and the task at hand. This knowledge area also requires an understanding of the fundamental principles in the discipline of geography, the \"language\" of spatial tasks. On a more advanced level, this area incorporates mathematical and graphical models that formalize these concepts, such as set theory, algebra, and semantic nets. Because of its wide range of foundational principles, this knowledge area forms a basis for the other knowledge areas. Wise design and use of geospatial technologies requires an understanding of the nature of geographic information, the social and philosophical context of geographic information, and the principles of geography. This knowledge area is especially closely tied to Knowledge Areas Data Modeling (DM) and Design Aspects (DA), as generic data models and application designs need to be grounded in sound conceptual models. The foundations of geographic information have developed over several decades. Philosophical and scientific views on the nature of space and time have evolved since the ancient Greeks. Early papers during the Quantitative Revolution, such as Berry (1964), began to formalize the structure of information used in geographic inquiry.The fundamental data structures and algorithms comprising the GIS software developed in the 1960`s and 1970`s were based on implicit \"common-sense\" conceptual models of geographic information. During the 1980`s, several researchers questioned these underlying assumptions. Some were refuted, other confirmed, and many extended. However, the most rapid pace of development in this area was during the 1990`s with the rise of GIScience as a distinct discipline, and the many cooperative initiatives it comprised.The new millennium has seen some of these foundational principles incorporated into commercial software, thus making theoretical knowledge even more important for practitioners. It is expected that the concepts in this knowledge area will be learned gradually. An introductory course may cover only a few topics in a cursory manner, an intermediate course on data modeling or data analysis may consider several theoretical topics of practical application, and a number of graduate courses could cover each topic in a research-oriented environment. Discussion of this knowledge area includes several terms that can have multiple meanings. For the purposes of this document, two in particular require definition: Geographic: Almost any subject or discourse involving earthly phenomena, studied from a spatial perspective at a medium scale (sub-astronomical and super-architectural). Phenomenon: Any subject of geographic discourse that is perceived to be external to the individual, including entities, events, processes, social constructs, and the like."

            "definition": "Proper design of geospatial applications, models, and databases, and the validation and verification of design activities, are critical components of work in all areas related to GIS and T. Design failures can negate well-intentioned efforts to apply concepts and technology to solve real-world problems. While sharing a number of concerns with general systems analysis, the unique and complex spatial elements of geospatial information provide significant additional challenges. The focus of this knowledge area is on the design of applications and databases for a particular need. The design of general-purpose models and tools (e.g., raster and vector) is covered in Knowledge Area DM Data Modeling. In the context of specific implementations, design activities fall into three general classes: 1. Application Design addresses the development of workflows, procedures, and customized software tools for using geospatial technologies and methods to accomplish both routine and unique tasks that are inherently geographic. 2. Analytic Model Design incorporates methods for developing effective mathematical and other models of spatial situations and processes. The design of the analytic model is often influenced by decisions that are made about data models and structures. 3. Database Design concerns the optimal organization of the necessary spatial data in a computer environment in order to efficiently sustain a particular application or enterprise. Several units in Knowledge Area GD Geospatial Data follow from Knowledge Area DA Design Aspects, especially those that discuss the collection of data in conformance with the designs discussed herein. This knowledge area is also closely related to Knowledge Area OI Organizational and Institutional Aspects, which discusses several issues relating to the management of systems in organizations after they are designed and implemented. Beyond GIS and T, this knowledge area has strong ties to information science and technology (e.g., Gorgone, G. B. and Gray, P., 2000, and Gorgone, G. B. and others, 2002), and to business management in the area of resource planning. Some of the methods of geospatial system design are identical to established methods in information system design, while others are unique."

Data modelling can be done in conjunction with the data base, e.g. through ER diagrams or according to the ISO 191xx standards by using UML. The costs of data acquisition can be tremendous, therefore the data represents an enormous value. This value has to be conserved through a safe long term data storage. Therefore data bases and especially relational and object relational data bases are crucial. For a proper storage and query of geographic information data bases are extended with specific data types and data structures. As data sets can be very large suitable compression techniques became important especially in the context of accessing and delivering geographical data, e.g. through services. XML based modeling languages for encoding also play and important role in this context"

Data modelling is a crucial issue as it defines the content of a spatial database and usefulness of these content (data) for certain applications. Data Modelling is performed using system neutral languages like UML (or more seldom ER-diagrams). These conceptual models have to be transferred to logical models (i.e. tables of a database). Data is stored in spatial data bases which are normally organized in an object relational way. For certain types of data specific data bases are used, like triple stores, NoSQL DBs, Array DBs etc. For data modelling quite a number of ISO standards are available for deriving the conceptual model as well as for rules for application schemas, spatial schemas, temporal schemas, Quality principles, encoding, 3D modelling (CityGML) etc. Data models provide the means for formalizing the spatio-temporal conceptualizations. Examples of spatial data model types are discrete (object-based), continuous (location-based), dynamic, and probabilistic. Mastery of the objectives presented in this knowledge area require knowledge and skills presented in the bodies of knowledge of allied fields, including computer science (ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force, 2001) and information systems (Gorgone & Gray, 2000; Gorgone & others, 2002)."

            "definition": "Rule-based models are based on logic programming with condition-action expressions, where the left side of the expressions consists of several conditions that returns a logical result, and the right side consists of several actions. The implementation of rule-based models is most often done by cellular automata models or agent-based models. Many geographic patterns and dynamics are formed by systems of interacting actors with heterogeneous characteristics and behaviours. A cellular automaton (CA) is a discrete dynamic system in which space is divided into regular spatial cells, and time progresses in discrete steps. Each cell in the system has one of a finite number of states. Agent-base models are constructed to represent these actors, their environments, and their interactions with one another. The aim of this topic is to provide knowledge about rule based models and to understand their advantages and disadvantages."

However, dealing with real world problems the full system can seldom be descried totally with the laws from natural science, and needs to be amended with other types of models. The aim of this topic is to present the use of equations based models and their advantages and challenges."

Simulation models are a relatively recent addition to the scientific toolbox, and the reasons for their widespread adoption are that High Performance Computing and huge amount of data from different sources have made this approach possible. In addition, some systems of interest like ecosystems, urban systems, social systems, and the global climate system are not amenable to experiments.

The central idea behind GAs is to mimic the Darwinian notion that selective breeding seeks optimum individuals in a given environment. In order to do this a GA requires a way of representing a solution to a (spatial) problem as if it were an individual viewed as a chromosome or `genome` like object. The aim of the topic is to provide fundamental understanding of the principles behind genetic algorithms, and its application in solving geospatial problems."

Geocomputation in short. Geocomputation covers a wide range of theories and methods aiming at studying complex spatio-temporal problems, which are difficult to analyse and model applying traditional spatial analytical and statistical methods due to data complexity and computational demands. As a rather new research agenda, Geocomputation is still seeking to define the field conceptually, although much efforts have been done. Being closely related to computational science, Geocomputation benefits from the still increasing performance in information and communication technology allowing geoprocessing to utilise parallel computing and distributed cloud computing. However, the close connection to computational science also requires frequent discussion on adopting new related topics like Big Data and Linked Data to the Geocomputation research agenda. Geocomputation has a very strong connection to Knowledge Area AM   Analytical methods. Skills in computer programming are generally needed to effectively apply most of the methods and tools under the Geocomputation headline."

            "definition": "Geospatial data represent measurements of the locations and attributes of phenomena at or near Earth`s surface. Information is data made meaningful in the context of a question or problem. Information is rendered from data by analytical methods. Information quality and value depends to a large extent on the quality and currency of data (though historical data are valuable for many applications). Geospatial data may have spatial, temporal, and attribute (descriptive) components, as well as associated metadata. Data may be acquired from primary or secondary data sources. Examples of primary data sources include surveying, remote sensing (including aerial and satellite imaging), the global positioning system (GPS), work logs (e.g., police traffic crash reports), environmental monitoring stations, and field surveys. Secondary geospatial or geospatial-temporal data can be acquired by digitizing and scanning analog maps, as well as from other sources, such as governmental agencies. The legitimacy of geographic information science as a discrete field has been claimed in terms of the unique properties of geospatial data. In a paper in which he coined the term GIScience, Goodchild (1992) identified several such properties, including: 1. Geospatial data represent spatial locations and non-spatial attributes measured at certain times. 2. The Earth`s surface is highly complex in shape and continuous in extent. 3. Geospatial data tend to be spatially autocorrelated. It has long been said that data account for the largest portion of geospatial project costs. While this maxim remains true for many projects, practitioners and their clients now can reasonably expect certain kinds of data to be freely or cheaply available via the World Wide Web. Federal, state, regional, and local government agencies, as well as commercial geospatial data producers, operate clearinghouses that provide access to geospatial data. Although geospatial data are much more abundant now than they were ten years ago, data quality issues persist. Good data are expensive to produce and to maintain. Proprietary interests simultaneously increase the supply of geospatial data and impede data accessibility. Standards for geospatial data and metadata are useful in facilitating effective search, retrieval, evaluation, integration with existing data, and appropriate uses. National and international organizations, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), develop and promulgate such standards. INSPIRE directive (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community) regulates geospatial data management"

Since the 1990s, scholars have criticized cartography and the GIS science from a wide range of perspectives. Common among these critiques are questioned assumptions about the purported benefits of GI and Society and attention to its unexamined risks. By promoting reflective practice among current and aspiring geospatial information professionals, an understanding of the range of critical perspectives increases the likelihood that geospatial information will fulfil its potential to benefit all stakeholders. Philosophical, psychological, and social underpinnings of these critiques are considered in Knowledge Area CF: Conceptual Foundations."

The history of its development is the sum of fragmented efforts, which have still not been fully integrated. Its potential benefits are often constrained and its potential impacts are not fully understood. Institutional and economic factors limit access to data, technology, and expertise by some of those who need it to make better decisions. Political, ideological, and personal issues aside, organizations invest in GIS&T when estimated benefits outweigh estimated costs. Evaluating costs and benefits is difficult, however and too often leads to nothing being done. For some individuals and groups, costs are prohibitive even though potential benefits are compelling. The legal framework provides a structure for regulating a number of key aspects of geographic information science, technology, and applications. Legal regimes determine who can claim the exclusive right to hold and use geospatial data, the conditions under which others may have access to the data, and what subsequent uses are permitted. Political struggles arise from conflicting proprietary and public interests about who benefits from geospatial information, and how the power to allocate the use of this information is, or should be, distributed among members of a society. The need to choose among conflicting interests sometimes poses ethical dilemmas for GIS&T professionals. The explosive growth of the geospatial information contributed by users through various application programming interfaces has made geospatial information is a powerful tool in the social media toola powerful media for the general public to communicate, but perhaps more importantly, geographic information have also become a tool media for constructive dialogs and interactions about social issues, recent growth of Web-based geospatial information and volunteered geographic information (VGI). Because so many public agencies and private organizations rely upon GIS&T for planning, decision making, and management, GIS&T increasingly affects and is used to direct daily life. Critical approaches to understanding the role of GIS in society equip practitioners to employ GIS&T reflectively. The critical approach specifically questions the assumptions and premises that underlie the economic, legal and political regimes and institutional structures within which GIS&T is implemented. Related concerns are considered in Knowledge Area OI: Organizational and Institutional Aspects."

As costs associated with collecting and maintaining geospatial data are high, sharing data means that users no longer need to duplicate data gathering and archiving, which leads to savings in terms of personnel, space/facilities, data acquisition and maintenance costs. One fundamental argument for sharing thus derives from scale economies in production. Because the cost of making data is high, there is a clear incentive to maximize the number of users of these data. Sharing allows data to be used repeatedly for many purposes, thus increasing their value without increasing their cost. Sharing data also leads to improved data quality. Moreover, in many cases, sharing data is the only way to get access to certain data sets, as the authority to collect and manage certain data lies with another public institution."

These framework agreement can involve one or multiple spatial data sets or services. Partnership agreements are often used to formalize the data sharing agreements among a broader group of partners. Participation in such a partnership often means participants share their data with other participants and get access to shared data. Another relevant mechanism is the use of licenses, which are mechanisms to give organizations and people the permission to use spatial data sets and services.

An SDI funding model provides the answer to the central question of where and how to seek funding for implementing and maintaining an SDI. Within an SDI often different funding models will be combined, as the selection of the most appropriate funding model will be linked to different activities and the associated costs. Costs of an SDI include both set-up costs (one off costs) and maintenance costs (yearly), of which certain costs need to be made for each data sets or each data provider and other costs for the infrastructure in general. The most commonly used SDI funding models are centralized government funding, decentralized government funding (e.g. for each data provider), partnership funding, funding through revenues, and government funding based on donor agencies or on European projects."

An key challenge in future SDI development will be the integration of these SDI`s in a wider context. In order to optimally take advantage of the data and services provided by an SDI, integrating these data and services into the processes and workflows of   public and private   organizations will be crucial. The concept of spatial enablement refers to the challenge of developing SDI`s in such a way that they provide an enabling platform that serves the wider needs of society in a transparent manner. Moreover, the diffusion of SDIs, together with the efforts to build a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and other developments in industry and civil society should be considered as elements in a the realization of a vision on the next-generation Digital Earth."

The focus of this knowledge area is on the organizations active in the GIS&T domain, and what happens within and between these organizations. The knowledge area is structured around five units. One unit considers the key organizations in the GIS&T domain, covering relevant public sector organizations at different administrative levels as well as organizations in other sectors of society. Among the organizational aspects covered in this knowledge area are all organizational issues related to the implementation, use and management of GI and GIS within organizations. While all topics related to the organizational structures, procedures and management of GI(S) are grouped into one unit, another unit focuses on issues related to the human factor of using GI and GIS, i.e. people, their skills and competencies, and the development and evaluation of these skills and competencies in the context of GIS&T training and education. The knowledge area includes also several inter-organizational and institutional aspects of GIS&T. Particular attention is paid to the concept of geospatial data sharing, which is about the creation of `spatial data` connections and relationships between different organizations in the GIS&T domain. Spatial data infrastructures are developed to promote, facilitate and coordinate the sharing of spatial data among data providers and data users, and consists of several technological and non-technological components. Many related topics are considered in the knowledge area GI and Society (WS), which also addresses several non-technological aspects related to GIS&T. In addition to this, also the knowledge areas `Design and Setup of Geographic Information Systems`, `Geospatial Data\" and Web-based GI` include several topics that are closely linked to the topics that are considered in this knowledge area. It can be argued that in order to fully master the knowledge and competencies that are presented in these knowledge areas, also basic knowledge and understanding of the organizational and institutional aspects is required."

In general, it involves first the discovery of the suitable services over the Web, and compose them in a certain workflow order and finally run the composed service which is the invocation stage. WSC has been a highly active research topic since the emergence of Web services in 2000s. \"Manual\" WSC is the form that the activities of discovery, composition and invocation are all done manually (by human). In the \"Semi-automated\" way, the discovery is done by the machine. In the \"full-automated\" approach all the above activities are done by the machine. There are no tools at the moment that achieve full automated composition. Web API composition is like WSC, the only difference is the fact that instead of web services there are Web APIs in WAPIC. There is no doubt that One would run into the very same problems of WSC concerning full automated composition. In other words, WAPIC would in no way be easier than WSC. Nevertheless, as far as semi automated form can be achived, WAPIC is valuable because the number of Web APIs increase drastically from day to day. The site \"programmableWeb\" lists 14 957 APIs at the moment. It is not easy to search for all those APIs manually for the discovery of suitable APIs for a given task."

            "definition": "This knowledge area is about Web Based Geographic Information management aspects and therefore it was given the name \"Web Based GI\" or \"WBG\" in short. It is implied by this name that the differentiating factor for this KA is the \"Web\". One must then be able to answer the questions like \"What functions do we delegate to the Web?\" or \"how WBGI is different from the traditional GI?\" Sticking to the functions of a GIS, which are inserting (adding), storing, manipulating, analysing and presenting the data, there is not a single system for effecting all these tasks anymore but the Web itself. For instance, there is no single database and its known-to-its users-definition, anymore but many different stores and many different definitions. Similarly, many different manipulation, analysis and presentation options compared with the options offered by a single or limited number of systems of traditional GI. In general, Web provides the means of leveraging distributed \"resources\" like data, information, or software. It is a \"collaboration medium\". A collaboration that enables rapid production or decision making. A collaboration that certainly introduces new dimensions to traditional GI handling. This is the justification of proposing this KA in addition to the KAs of the original BoK. For the mentioned collaboration to happen, data or any other type of a resource have to accessible on the Web. This means that it should have a Web \"address\" and a \"definition\" that is understandable either by \"human\" or \"machine\". \"Machine understandable definitions\" refers to the dimension of \"semantics\" and \"ontologies\" which are also included under this KA. When one talks about publishing resources then \"catalogue services\" and more importantly \"discovery\" dimension comes into the scene. On the other hand, \"Linked Data (LOD)\" and \"Open Data\", highly popular recent trends and two of the above mentioned dimensions of Web GI have also been covered under this KA. Like the other dimensions of Web GI, both LD and OD aspects must be known to GI communities with differing degrees of expertise. The concepts of \"interoperability\" and \"Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)\", hot topics of GI communities for many years, have been thought to be dealt with under this KA as well with the justification that \"Web GI\" is a much broader concept than SDI, This is by the fact that SDI refers to a much narrower content and context of \"collaboration\" then Web GI. Therefore, Geospatial data interoperability and some of the related concepts which were classified under KA, \"Geospatial data in the original BoK were moved under KA11 with the updated context. Another issue is the coverage of Spatial Analysis (SA), data manipulation aspects of GI by KA11. The SA aspects are covered by other KAs like \"Geocomputation\" and \"Analytical methods\". If the analysis operations, in an undertaking, would be handled by web services this is already covered by \"data processing\" web services, application development unit and Web services composition under that unit. The important thing is to have the knowledge about a specific analysis operation; Employing it as a web service would require no more knowledge than using any other web service. SA is covered by KA11 in as much as it should have been."

The total incident energy will interact with the surface in one or more of these three ways. The proportions of each will depend on the wavelength of the energy and the material and condition of the feature. Absorption (A) occurs when radiation (energy) is absorbed into the target while transmission (T) occurs when radiation passes through a target. Reflection (R) occurs when radiation \"bounces\" off the target and is redirected. The reflectance R is defined by the ratio of reflected radiant power to incident radiant power. The transmittance T of a medium is defined by the ratio of transmitted radiant power to incident radiant power. The absorptance A of a medium or target is defined by the ratio of absorbed radiant power to incident radiant power. Conservation of energy require that, at a certain wavelenght: R+T+A=1. To express the circumstance that the reflection can occurre in different direction as the surface deviates from a specular one, becoming rough the concept of surface scattering has been introduced.

The passive systems can be further subdivided into those that detect radiation emitted by the Sun (this radiation consists mostly of ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared radiation), and those that detect the thermal radiation that is emitted by all objects that are not at absolute zero (i.e. all objects). For objects at typical terrestrial temperatures, this thermal emission occurs mostly in the infrared part of the spectrum, at wavelengths of the order of 10 μm (the so called thermal infrared region), although measurable quantities of radiation also occur at longer wavelengths, as far as the microwave part of the spectrum. Active systems can, in principle, use any type of electromagnetic radiation. In practice, however, they are restricted by the transparency of the Earth’s atmosphere."

The atmospheric effect is sometimes referred to as the “greenhouse effect” because in a similar way glass, which covers a greenhouse, transmits short-wave solar radiation, however absorbs long-wave thermal infrared radiation. Imagine a beam of radiation travelling through a small section of air. The air is made up of changing concentrations of different species, with all molecules absorbing and emitting thermal radiation at different rates. As the radiation travels through different layers of the atmosphere, the intensity of radiation will constantly be modified by both absorption and emission processes as described by the Schwarzschild's equation. In case of a sensor on board of a satellite, the net radiation measured would be that which is attenuated through each layer (as small increments of absorption and emission) from the surface to the top of the atmosphere plus the radiation emitted directly from the surface. In this case, this process can be described by the radiative transfer equation (RTE)."

Mie scattering defines the interaction of light with particulate matter with a dimension comparable to the wavelength of the incident radiation. It can be regarded as the radiation resulting from a large number of coherently excited elementary emitters (molecules for example) in a particle. Since the linear dimension of the particle is comparable to the wavelength of the radiation, interference effects occur. The most noticeable difference to Rayleigh scattering is, generally, the much weaker wavelength dependence and a strong dominance of the forward direction in the scattered light. The calculation of the Mie scattering cross section, which involves summing over slowly converging series, is complicated even for spherical particles, it is worse for particles of an arbitrary shape. However, the Mie theory for spherical particles is well developed and a number of numerical models exist to calculate scattering phase functions and extinction coefficients for given aerosol types and particle size distributions."

            "definition": "Each time radiation passes through the atmosphere it is attenuated to some extent. We refer to this attenuation with the term 'atmosphere transmittance'. The typical atmospheric transmittance between wavelengths of 250 nm and 2500 nm, i.e. in the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared and short-wave-infrared regions of the spectrum is dominated bywater vapour, although methane, carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen are also responsible for a few absorption lines. The behaviour in the visible region is dominated by molecular Rayleigh scattering. At the short-wavelength end of the spectrum, in the ultraviolet, absorption by ozone becomes very significant. Above 2500 nm up to the upper limit (13500 nm) of the optical electromagnetic spectrum useful for Remote Sensing, the atmosphere transmittance is mainly affected by triatomic molecules (H20, CO2 and O3). However, the atmospheric effects (transmittance) is strongly depending on the electromagntic wavelength. Remote Sensing exploits the region of relative atmospheric transparency called atmospheric windows."

            "definition": "With the term 'atmospheric windows' we refer to the regions of the electromagnetic spectrum where the interaction of the atmosphere with the electromagnetic radiation is minimized. There are three main ‘windows’ in the Earth's atmosphere. The first of these includes the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) parts of the spectrum, between wavelengths of about 0.38 μm and 3.5 μm, although it does also contain a number of opaque regions. The second is a rather narrow region between about 8 μm and 15 μm, in which is found the bulk of the thermal infrared (TIR) radiation from objects at typical terrestrial temperatures. The third more or less corresponds to the microwave region, between wavelengths of a few millimetres and a few metres. Thus we can expect that any active system designed to penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere will operate in one of these three ‘window’ regions."

            "nodeName": 535,
            "definition": "The orbit of a satellite is commonly defined through its so called Keplerian parameters. These parameters represent the trajectory that the satellite will follow if no-perturbation are acting on it. A series of forces act on the satellite to perturb it away from the nominal orbit. We can classify these perturbations, or variations in the orbital elements, based on how they affect the Keplerian elements. The actual orbit of a satellite will result from a combination of these perturbations. Periodic maneouvers are needed to bring the orbit back to nominal conditions. The lifetime of a satellite is defined as the time interval that it takes to decay from its initial altitude to an altitude causing the satellite reentry down to the atmosphere. Therefore lifetime of a satellite should not be confused with the time during which the satellite will provide useful information (this operational phase, in general, is designed to last 5 - 7 years). In fact, all satellite terminating operational phases in orbits passing through the LEO region should be de-orbited or, where appropriate, manoeuvred to an orbit with suitably-reduced lifetime, that is, should be left in an orbit where drag and other perturbations will limit lifetime. The actual duration of the satellite in orbit will depend from the intensity of the perturbations which will affect its orbit. In case of satellite on GEO orbit, at the end of the operational phases they will be located on a disposal orbit, that is an orbit which do not cross the protected region. The protected region is the altitude region ranging from GEO - 200 km to GEO + 200 km and inclination region between -15 deg and +15 deg. Satellites in low Earth orbit, with perigee altitudes below 1000 km, are predominantly subject to atmospheric drag. This force very slowly tends to circularise and reduce the altitude of the orbit. The rate of 'decay' of the orbit becomes very rapid at altitudes less than 200 km, and by the time the satellite is down to 180 km it will only have a few hours to live before it makes a fiery re-entry down to the Earth."

However, SAR interferometry is applied not in the optical domain of photogrammetry, but in the realm of radar geometry, to exploit radar's ranging capability. Because SARs can accurately measure differences in slandt-range distances to the same feature from separate observation points, the technique can provide very accurate topographic information."

Stereopairs and stereoscopic coverage enable the extraction of 3D representations of the environment from remotely sensed imagery. Most aerial photographs are taken with frame cameras along flight lines, or flight strips. [...] Successive photographs are generally taken with some degree of endlap [, i.e. overlap]. Not only does this lapping ensure total coverage along a flightline, but an endlap of at least 50 percent is essential for total stereoscopic coverage of a project area. Stereoscopic coverage consists of adjacent pairs of overlapping vertical photographs called stereopairs. Stereopairs provide two different perspectives of the ground area in their region of endlap [overlap]. When images forming a stereopair are viewed through a stereoscope, each eye psychologically occupies the vantage point from which the respective image of the stereopair was taken in flight. The result is the perception of a three-dimensional stereomodel. As an input to photogrammetry analysis procedures, stereopairs from flight strips enable the extraction of digital elevation models (DEM), orthophotos, thematic GIS data, and other derived products through the use of digital raster images and relatively sophisticated analytical techniques. With the availability of close-range UAV and terrestrial hand-held camera data, 3D reconstructions of buildings (even indoors) and other objects on the terrain surface become possible."

Atmospheric correction is necessary if biophysical parameters are going to be extracted from water (e.g. chlorophyll a, suspended sediment, temperature) or vegetation (e.g., biomass, leaf area index, chlorophyll, percent canopy closure). There are several ways to atmospherically correct remotely sensed data, including straight forward approaches and others that are founded on physical principles and requiring a significant amount of information to function properly (Cracknell and Hayes, 1993). Two major types are absolute atmospheric correction and relative atmospheric correction."

Storage and processing consume valuable resources. It is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data while retaining the information content inherent in the image.

For each local minimum, a catchment basin comprises all points whose path of steepest descent terminates at this minimum. Watersheds separate basins from each other.

It represents the quality of image interpretation/understanding: how are the different objects or classes recognized/evaluated integrally. A bridge above a water surface, like river can be detected in pixel-wised manner, but the question is how coherent they are in the output map. This phenomenon has very close to the thematic consistency, where the recognition integrity is represented in this way. The topological consistency is defined mainly for network-type surface objects, like roads or rivers, where the connection of all atomic segments are rated by this measure. Urban mapping focuses on the built environment objects, where e.g. house-parcel inclusions are described by this feature. The temporal consistency is for monitoring again, representing for example the possibility or impossibility of land cover changes in time. Having multiple data sources (even airborne or terrestrial), their integral usage can be qualified by this measure."
