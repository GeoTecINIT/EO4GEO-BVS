# BoK Visualization and Search

The [BoK Visualization and Search](https://bok.eo4geo.eu) tool allows users to navigate and visualize the EO4GEO Body of Knowledge (BoK) in a graphical and textual way. Starting from higher level concepts, representing areas of knowledge in the field, one can browse down to more detailed concepts. Each concept has a permanent URL to easily refer to it, a description, relationships to other concepts and associated skills. Previous versions of each concept can also be browsed, and an advanced search is available to search in concepts and their fields. 

#### Authors
The EO4GEO BoK tools are developed by the [Geospatial Technologies Research Group](http://geotec.uji.es/) (GEOTEC) from the University Jaume I, Castell√≥n (Spain) and are Licensed under GNU GPLv3.
